# Sheetsense: Your Finances, Visualized & Private

Sheetsense is a high-performance, privacy-first personal finance platform that transforms your unstructured Google Sheets into a professional-grade wealth management dashboard. 

By combining the flexibility of spreadsheets with the power of modern web technologies, Sheetsense gives you a 360-degree view of your net worth, investments, and cash flow without ever compromising your data privacy.

## 💎 Core Philosophy: Privacy by Design
Unlike traditional fintech apps, Sheetsense has **no middleman**. 
- **Zero Servers:** Your financial data is never sent to a Sheetsense server. It moves directly between Google Drive and your browser.
- **Local-First:** All processing happens on your device. Your data stays in your control, stored in your browser's secure encrypted vault.
- **Minimal Scopes:** We use the `drive.file` permission, meaning the app can *only* see the specific files you choose to connect.
